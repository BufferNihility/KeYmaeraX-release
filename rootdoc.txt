==KeYmaera X: An Axiomatic Tactical Theorem Prover==
================================================

[[http://keymaeraX.org/ KeYmaera X]] is a theorem prover for [[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aplatzer/logic/dL.html differential dynamic logic]] (dL), a logic for specifying and verifying properties of hybrid systems with mixed discrete and continuous dynamics. Reasoning about complicated hybrid systems requires support for sophisticated proof techniques, efficient computation, and a user interface that crystallizes salient properties of the system. KeYmaera X allows users to specify custom proof search techniques as tactics, execute tactics in parallel, and interface with partial proofs via an extensible user interface.
