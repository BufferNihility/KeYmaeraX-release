==KeYmaera X: An Axiomatic Tactical Theorem Prover==
================================================

KeYmaera X is a theorem prover for differential dynamic logic (dL), a logic for specifying and verifying properties of hybrid systems with mixed discrete and continuous dynamics. Reasoning about complicated hybrid systems requires support for sophisticated proof techniques, efficient computation, and a user interface that crystallizes salient properties of the system. KeYmaera X allows users to specify custom proof search techniques as tactics, execute tactics in parallel, and interface with partial proofs via an extensible user interface.

KeYmaera X is built up from a small trusted core. The core contains a finite list of locally sound dL axioms that are instantiated using a uniform substitution proof rule. Isolating all soundness-critical reasoning in this axiomatic core obviates the otherwise intractable task of ensuring that proof search algorithms are implemented correctly. This enables advanced proof search features---such as aggressive, speculative proof search and user-defined tactics built using a flexible tactic language---without correctness concerns that could undermine the usefulness of automated analysis.
