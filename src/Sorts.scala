/**
 * Sorts
 * =====
 *
 * The rational behind the below type hierarchy Sort is to let scala
 * discarge ill typed terms whenever this is possible. That is, scala
 * will automatically check type safety for builtin sorts. However,
 * because Sorts can be user defined. We have to support the creation
 * of new Sorts, which prevents compile time checks for these sorts.
 * We therefore equipped terms over user defined sorts with runtime
 * checks to assert type safety.
