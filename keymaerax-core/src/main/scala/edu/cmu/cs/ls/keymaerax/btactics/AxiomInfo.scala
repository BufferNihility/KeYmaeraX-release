/**
  * Since axioms are always referred to by their names (which are strings), we have the following problems:
  * 1) It's hard to keep everything up to date when a new axiom is added
  * 2) We don't get any static exhaustiveness checking when we case on an axiom
  *
  * AxiomInfo exists to help fix that. An AxiomInfo is just a collection of per-axiom information. The tests for
  * this object dynamically ensure it is exhaustive with respect to AxiomBase and DerivedAxioms. By adding a new
  * field to AxiomInfo you can ensure that all new axioms will have to have that field.
