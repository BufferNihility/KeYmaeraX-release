/**
 * Soundness-critical core of the KeYmaera X theorem prover.
 * 
 * ==Usage Overview==
 * [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaera.core.Provable.startProof(Sequent)]] begins a new proof of a
 * [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaera.core.Sequent]] containing the conjectured differential dynamic logic formula.
 * A proof [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaera.core.Rule]] can be applied to any subgoal of a [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaera.core.Provable]] to advance the proof
 * until that Provable has been proved since [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaera.core.Provable.isProved]] is true.
 * {{{
 *   import scala.collection.immutable._
 *   val verum = new Sequent(Seq(), IndexedSeq(), IndexedSeq(True))
 *   // conjecture
 *   val provable = Provable.startProof(verum)
 *   // construct a proof
 *   val proving = provable(CloseTrue(SuccPos(0)), 0)
 *   // check if proof successful
 *   if (proving.isProved) println("Successfully proved " + proving.proved)
 * }}}
 * Of course, [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaera.tactics]] are an easier way to describe proof search procedures.
 * Multiple Provable objects for subderivations obtained from different sources can also be merged
 * into a single Provable object with [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaera.core.Provable.apply(Provable,Subgoal)]].
 *
 *
 * ==Syntax==
 * Immutable algebraic data structures for the expressions of differential dynamic logic have type
 * [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaera.core.Expression]].
 * Expressions are categorized into [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaera.core.Term]], [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaera.core.Formula]] and [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaera.core.Program]]
 * in line with the syntactic categories of the grammar of differential dynamic logic.
 * See section 2.1
 *
 * ==Static Semantics==
 * [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaera.core.StaticSemantics]] defines the static semantics of differential dynamic logic
 * in terms of the free variables and bound variables that expressions have as well as their signatures.
 * See section 2.3
 *
 * ==Uniform Substitutions==
 * [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaera.core.USubst]] defines uniform substitutions and their application mechanism
 * for differential dynamic logic.
 * See section 3.0
 * [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaera.core.UniformSubstitutionRule]] applies uniform substitutions as a proof rule.
 * [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaera.core.AxiomaticRule]] generates uniform substitution instances of axiomatic rules.
 * See section 4
 *
 * ==Axioms==
 * The axioms and axiomatic rules of differential dynamic logic are listed in [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaera.core.AxiomBase]].
 * See section 4 and 5.0
 *
 * ==Sequent Proof Rules==
 * The uniform substitution and bound variable renaming rules as well as
 * efficient propositional sequent proof rules and Skolemization for differential dynamic logic
 * are all of type [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaera.core.Rule]], which are the only proof rules that can ever be applied to a proof.
 *
 * ==Error Reporting==
 * Errors from the prover core are reported as exceptions of type [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaera.core.ProverException]]
 * whose main responsibility is to propagate problems in traceable ways to the user by augmenting them
 * with contextual information.
 *
 * ==Lemma Mechanism==
 * A lemma database and an interface to real arithmetic decision procedures are defined in
 * [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaera.core.LemmaDB]] and [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaera.core.QETool]]
 * along with an implementation of a lemma data base using files [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaera.core.FileLemmaDB]]
 *
 * ==Set Lattice==
 * A data structure for sets (or rather lattice completions of sets) is provided in
 * [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaera.core.SetLattice]] based on Scala's immutable sets.
