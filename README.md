KeYmaera4
=========

Repository for the reimplementation of KeYmaera.
This reimplementation should include parallel proof search and a simpler
language to define strategies. Furthermore, there should be support for user
defined strategies.

Specification
=============

The goal of KeYmaera4 is to implement the proof calculus of differential dynamic logic in a way that is amenable to soundness ensurance by way of a small trusted LCF-style core while still being amenable to automatic theorem proving.
Differential dynamic logic and its Hilbert-type and sequent proof calculi have been described and specified in more detail in:

A secondary goal of KeYmaera4 is to also make it possible to implement extensions of differential dynamic logic, such as quantified differential dynamic logic, which, along with its proof calculus, has been described and specified in
