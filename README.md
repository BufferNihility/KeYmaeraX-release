KeYmaera X
==========

KeYmaera X is a theorem prover for differential dynamic logic (dL), a logic for specifying and verifying properties of hybrid systems with mixed discrete and continuous dynamics. Reasoning about complicated hybrid systems requires support for sophisticated proof techniques, efficient computation, and a user interface that crystallizes salient properties of the system. KeYmaera X allows users to specify custom proof search techniques as tactics, execute tactics in parallel, and interface with partial proofs via an extensible user interface.

KeYmaera X is built up from a small trusted core. The core contains a finite list of locally sound dL axioms that are instantiated using a uniform substitution proof rule. Isolating all soundness-critical reasoning in this axiomatic core obviates the otherwise intractable task of ensuring that proof search algorithms are implemented correctly. This enables advanced proof search features---such as aggressive, speculative proof search and user-defined tactics built using a flexible tactic language---without correctness concerns that could undermine the usefulness of automated analysis. Early experimentation with KeYmaera X suggests that a single layer of tactics on top of the axiomatic core provides a rich language for implementing novel and highly sophisticated automatic proof procedures.

Installation
============

The easiest way to run KeYmaera X from source is to install its dependencies and run HyDRA via SBT:

    * Install Scala (and the JRE).
    * Install SBT and following the instructions in the Building section.

Building
========

We use the Scala Build Tool (sbt). Installation instructions are available
at the link following:

http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html

Detailed instructions are available at that website as well. Briefly, type

    sbt compile

to compile the source code. First-time compilation may take a while, since it downloads all necessary libraries,
including Scala itself. The build file includes paths to the Mathematica JLink jar, for example for Mac as follows.

    unmanagedJars in Compile += file("/Applications/Mathematica.app/SystemFiles/Links/JLink/JLink.jar")

If JLink.jar is in a non-default location on your computer, add a new line to build.sbt.

Type

    sbt test

to run the regression test case suite.
If you run into problems during the compilation process, use "sbt clean" for a fresh start to remove stale files.

The Wiki contains extended build instructions and solutions to other
common sbt problems:

https://github.com/LS-Lab/KeYmaera4/wiki/Building-Instructions

Generating Scaladoc Documentation
=================================

To generate Scaladoc documentation files, run:

    sbt doc

Documentation will be generated for each subproject in the 
`target/scala-x.xx/api` directory of the subproject. 
For instance, `keymaerax-core/target/scala-2.10/api` for the core subproject.

To generate unified scaladoc for all subprojects, run:

    sbt unidoc

Documentation will be generated for the whole project in the `target/scala-x.xx/unidoc` directory.
For instance `target/scala-2.10/api`.

Main documentation to consider:

    http://keymaerax.org/doc/dL-grammar.md - concrete syntax for input language Differential Dynamic Logic
    edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.core.package   - KeYmaera X kernel, proof certificates, main data structures
    edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.parser.package - Parser and pretty printer with concrete syntax and notation
    edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.tactics.package - Tactic library
    edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.tactics.TactixLibrary - Main tactic library for most common cases
    edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.launcher.KeYmaeraX - command-line launcher for KeYmaera X

IntelliJ IDEA
=============

If you want to use the IntelliJ IDEA development environment, install it:
- Install IntelliJ IDEA
- Install the Scala plugin

Project Setup
- Create a new Scala project, backed by SBT
- Select a JDK as your project SDK, add a new one if not previously added
- Check `update automatically` (not checked by default), so that updates to build.sbt are reflected automatically in the project

Create a new run configuration of type Application.
- Main class: `edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.hydra.Boot`
- Set the working directory to the project path
- Use the classpath of your project module

Test cases:
- Right click on project folder keymaerax-webui/src/test to mark this directory as Test Sources Root.
- Make sure the JVM option -Xss20M is included in the run configuration.
- Right click on the test folder to run all its ScalaTests.

Front End
=========

The Web UI web user interface front end of KeYmaera X can be started as follows:

    sbt assembly
    java -jar keymaerax-webui/target/scala-2.10/KeYmaeraX-assembly-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar -ui
    open http://localhost:8090/index_bootstrap.html

The first command builds a .JAR, and the second command runs the built .jar. If the jar won't start because of an error `no manifest found` you may have to run `sbt clean` first.
In case of errors about `invalid or corrupt jarfile`, please update Java to a newer version.

For development purposes, the Web UI can be run from an IDE by selecting as the Main class if you pass its JVM the option -Xss20M:

    keymaerax-webui/src/main/scala/edu/cmu/cs/ls/keymaerax/hydra/Boot.scala

Note that using the launcher/Main class won't work in IntelliJ but Boot.scala must be used instead.

Errors related to JLinkNative Library are caused by incompatibilities of Java 1.8 in combination with Mathematica 9.
It is recommended to use Mathematica 10.

KeYmaera X is successfully started when you see the following console output

    Bound to localhost/127.0.0.1:8090

To find out how to use KeYmaera X from command line run

    java -Xss20M -jar keymaerax-webui/target/scala-2.10/KeYmaeraX-assembly-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar -ui

Make sure you have Java 1.8 for using command line. Java 1.7 and earlier versions may not work.

Source Code Layout
==================

build.sbt - SBT configuration file

The project is split into two subprojects, `keymaerax-core` for the core functionalities of the prover and `keymaerax-webui` for everything else.

    keymaerax-core/src/ - Source code directory
    keymaerax-core/src/main/scala - source code (edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax)
    keymaerax-webui/src/ - Source code directory for Web UI etc.
    keymaerax-webui/src/test/scala - tests run by `sbt test`
    target/ - Generated files directory created by sbt on first compilation.
    target/scala-2.10/classes/ - Target directory for sbt compilation.    

Within the `edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax` namespace, source code is separated according to functionality:

    .core    - Soundness-critical core
    .parser  - Parsing and pretty printing
    .tactics - Tactic framework, including tactic implementations and the scheduler
    .tools   - Arithmetic back-ends

The additional packages in the directory `keymaerax-webui/src/main/scala` are separated into:

    .api     - Scala API for proof and tactics management etc.
    .codegen - Code generation tools to generate C-Code etc.
    .hydra   - HyDRA Hybrid Distributed Reasoning Architecture server with REST API and database
    .launcher - KeYmaera X command line launcher with main program
    .tacticsinterface - Interface to the actics exposed to the web UI and REST API. Tactic combinator parser.

Test Cases
==========

The full test suite can be run by

    sbt test

Selectively running individual test cases within sbt:

    sbt
    sbt>  test-only *USubst*

Or, run on a more fine-grained level within a class use
object MyTest extends Tag("MyTest")

    object MyTest extends Tag("MyTest")
    it should "do something useful" taggedAs(MyTest) in {....}
    it should "do anything useful" taggedAs(MyTest) in {....}
    it should "do more good" taggedAs(MoreTest) in {....}

Then in sbt interactive mode run   

    sbt>  test-only -- -n "MyTest MoreTest"

To inline scala console output alongside the test suite information, first do:

    sbt>  set logBuffered in Test := false

The Wiki contains an introduction to the testing framework:

http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide


Optional Database Alternative: MongoDB
======================================

If you prefer to work with a MongoDB than with SQL you also need to install

    * Install MongoDB. Be sure that that your machine is behind a firewall and/or edit the MongoDB configuration file so that the server binds to the loopback address.

Make sure to run the following before starting KeYmaera X:

    mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf

Specification
=============

The goal of KeYmaera X is to implement the proof calculus of differential dynamic logic in a way that is amenable to soundness ensurance by way of a small trusted LCF-style core while still being amenable to automatic theorem proving.
