KeYmaera4
=========

Repository for the reimplementation of KeYmaera.
This reimplementation should include parallel proof search and a simpler
language to define strategies. Furthermore, there should be support for user
defined strategies.

Building
========

We use the Scala Build Tool (sbt). Installation instructions are available
at the link following:

http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html

Instructions are available at that website as well. Briefly, type

    sbt test

to run the regression test case suite. To run the KeYmaera parser use:

    sbt run

If you run into problems during the compilation process, use "sbt clean" for a fresh start to remove stale files.

To make sure sbt does not throw java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space

    edit ~/.sbtconfig
    SBT_OPTS="-XX:MaxPermSize=256M"

The Wiki contains extended build instructions and solutions to toher
common sbt problems:

Front End
=========

sbt "~ re-start"
open http://localhost:8080/static/index.html in web browser
open .key file in KeYmaera 4 HyDRA
right click to interact

Proof Tree Viewer
=================

To view proof trees converted to JSON by TermTests.print you can use
jsgui/proofviewer.html

Simply deploy proofviewer.html to any webserver and put the JSON
descirption into resources/proof.json in the same directory on the
webserver. Please note that JSON sources cannot be read from file-urls
and thus have to be accessed through a webserver. There are no
specific requirements for the webserver since it is only servering
html and the JavaScript part is interpreted in the browser on the
client anyway.

Source Layout
=============

build.sbt - SBT configuration file

jsgui/ - The javascript front-end

src/ - Source code directory

src/main/scala - source code (edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaera)

Within the keymaera namespace, code is separated according to functionality:

    .core    - Soundness-critical core
    .parser  - Parsing and pretty printing
    .tactics - Tactic framework, including tactic implementations and the scheduler
    .tools   - Arithmetic back-ends

src/test/scala - tests run by `sbt test`

The wiki contains an introduction to the testing framework:
https://github.com/LS-Lab/KeYmaera4/wiki/How-to-Add-Tests
http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide

target/ - Created by sbt on first compilation.

target/scala-2.10/classes/ - Target directory for sbt compilation.

Test Cases
==========

The full test suite can be run by

    sbt test

Selectively running individual test cases within sbt:
sbt> test-only TacticTests
Or, on a more fine-grained level within a class use
vobject MyTest extends Tag("MyTest")

    object MyTest extends Tag("MyTest")
    it should "do something useful" taggedAs(MyTest) in {....}
    it should "do anything useful" taggedAs(MyTest) in {....}
    it should "do more good" taggedAs(MoreTest) in {....}

Then in sbt interactive moe run   

    sbt>  test-only -- -n "MyTest MoreTest"

To inline scala console output alongside the test suite information, first do:

    sbt>  set logBuffered in Test := false

Proof Tree Viewer
=================

To view proof trees converted to JSON by TermTests.print you can use
jsgui/proofviewer.html

Simply deploy proofviewer.html to any webserver and put the JSON
descirption into resources/proof.json in the same directory on the
webserver. Please note that JSON sources cannot be read from file-urls
and thus have to be accessed through a webserver. There are no
specific requirements for the webserver since it is only servering
html and the JavaScript part is interpreted in the browser on the
client anyway.

Specification
=============

The goal of KeYmaera4 is to implement the proof calculus of differential dynamic logic in a way that is amenable to soundness ensurance by way of a small trusted LCF-style core while still being amenable to automatic theorem proving.
Differential dynamic logic and its Hilbert-type and sequent proof calculi have been described and specified in more detail in:

The advanced proof techniques of differential invariants, differential cuts, and differential ghosts are described and specified in

Logical Methods in Computer Science, 8(4), pages 1-38, 2012. 

A secondary goal of KeYmaera4 is to also make it possible to implement extensions of differential dynamic logic, such as quantified differential dynamic logic, which, along with its proof calculus, has been described and specified in
