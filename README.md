KeYmaera X
==========

KeYmaera X is a theorem prover for differential dynamic logic (dL), a logic for specifying and verifying properties of hybrid systems with mixed discrete and continuous dynamics. Reasoning about complicated hybrid systems requires support for sophisticated proof techniques, efficient computation, and a user interface that crystallizes salient properties of the system. KeYmaera X allows users to specify custom proof search techniques as tactics, execute tactics in parallel, and interface with partial proofs via an extensible user interface.

KeYmaera X is built up from a small trusted core. The core contains a finite list of locally sound dL axioms that are instantiated using a uniform substitution proof rule. Isolating all soundness-critical reasoning in this axiomatic core obviates the otherwise intractable task of ensuring that proof search algorithms are implemented correctly. This enables advanced proof search features---such as aggressive, speculative proof search and user-defined tactics built using a flexible tactic language---without correctness concerns that could undermine the usefulness of automated analysis. Early experimentation with KeYmaera X suggests that a single layer of tactics on top of the axiomatic core provides a rich language for implementing novel and highly sophisticated automatic proof procedures.

Installation
============

The easiest way to run KeYmaera X from source is to install its dependencies and run HyDRA via SBT:

    * Install Scala (and the JRE).
    * Install SBT and following the instructions in the Building section.

Building
========

We use the Scala Build Tool (sbt). Installation instructions are available
at the link following:

http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html

Detailed instructions are available at that website as well. Briefly, type

    sbt compile

to compile the source code. First-time compilation may take a while, since it downloads all necessary libraries,
including Scala itself. The build file includes paths to the Mathematica JLink jar, for example for Mac as follows.

    unmanagedJars in Compile += file("/Applications/Mathematica.app/SystemFiles/Links/JLink/JLink.jar")

If JLink.jar is in a non-default location on your computer, add a new line to build.sbt.

Type

    sbt test

to run the regression test case suite.
If you run into problems during the compilation process, use "sbt clean" for a fresh start to remove stale files.

The Wiki contains extended build instructions and solutions to other
common sbt problems:

https://github.com/LS-Lab/KeYmaera4/wiki/Building-Instructions

Generating Scaladoc
===================

To generate Scaladoc documentation files, run:

    sbt doc

Documentation will be generated for each subproject in the 
`target/scala-x.xx/api` directory of the subproject. 
For instance, `keymaerax-core/target/scala-2.10/api` for the core subproject.

To generate unified scaladoc for all subprojects, run:

    sbt unidoc


IntelliJ IDEA
=============

If you want to use the IntelliJ IDEA development environment, install it:
- Install IntelliJ IDEA
- Install the Scala plugin

Project Setup
- Create a new Scala project, backed by SBT
- Select a JDK as your project SDK, add a new one if not previously added
- Check `update automatically` (not checked by default), so that updates to build.sbt are reflected automatically in the project

Create a new run configuration of type Application.
- Main class: `edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.hydra.Boot`
- Set the working directory to the project path
- Use the classpath of your project module

Front End
=========

    sbt "~ re-start"
    open http://localhost:8090/index_bootstrap.html

The option re-start ensures that the server is automatically restarted whenever a source file changes.

Errors related to JLinkNative Library are caused by Java 1.8 in combination with Mathematica 9.
Either run using Java 1.7, or update to Mathematica 10.

KeYmaera X is successfully started when you see the following console output

    Bound to localhost/127.0.0.1:8090

Source Code Layout
==================

build.sbt - SBT configuration file

keymaerax-core/src/ - Source code directory

keymaerax-core/src/main/scala - source code (edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax)

Within the edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax namespace, code is separated according to functionality:

    .core    - Soundness-critical core
    .parser  - Parsing and pretty printing
    .tactics - Tactic framework, including tactic implementations and the scheduler
    .tools   - Arithmetic back-ends

keymaerax-webui/src/ - Source code directory for Web UI etc.

keymaerax-webui/src/test/scala - tests run by `sbt test`

The wiki contains an introduction to the testing framework:
https://github.com/LS-Lab/KeYmaera4/wiki/How-to-Add-Tests
http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide

target/ - Generated files directory created by sbt on first compilation.

target/scala-2.10/classes/ - Target directory for sbt compilation.

Test Cases
==========

The full test suite can be run by

    sbt test

Selectively running individual test cases within sbt:

    sbt
    sbt>  test-only *USubst*

Or, run on a more fine-grained level within a class use
object MyTest extends Tag("MyTest")

    object MyTest extends Tag("MyTest")
    it should "do something useful" taggedAs(MyTest) in {....}
    it should "do anything useful" taggedAs(MyTest) in {....}
    it should "do more good" taggedAs(MoreTest) in {....}

Then in sbt interactive mode run   

    sbt>  test-only -- -n "MyTest MoreTest"

To inline scala console output alongside the test suite information, first do:

    sbt>  set logBuffered in Test := false

Optional Database Alternative: MongoDB
=============================

If you prefer to work with a MongoDB than with SQL you also need to install

    * Install MongoDB. Be sure that that your machine is behind a firewall and/or edit the MongoDB configuration file so that the server binds to the loopback address.

Make sure to run the following before starting KeYmaera X:

    mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf

Specification
=============

The goal of KeYmaera4 is to implement the proof calculus of differential dynamic logic in a way that is amenable to soundness ensurance by way of a small trusted LCF-style core while still being amenable to automatic theorem proving.
Differential dynamic logic and its Hilbert-type and sequent proof calculi have been described and specified in more detail in:
