Differential Dynamic Logic
==========================

Grammar of Concrete Syntax
--------------------------

The grammar for the concrete syntax of differential dynamic logic is given below in order of ascending precedence, i.e. operators towards the beginning of the grammar bind stronger than later operators. Unary operators bind stronger than binary operators, which is why unary operators come later. Also ; binds stronger than ++ and & stronger than | stronger than both -> and <->. That is precedence is

    ^ < * < / < + < -
    ! < & < | < -> < <->
    * < ; < ++

Associativity is left-associative, i.e. x-y-z is (x-y)-z unless noted otherwise.

==Terms==

    T ::= x | x' | num | ∙ | f(T) | f() | -T | T^T | T*T | T/T | T+T | T-T | (T)' | (T) 

with `T^T` right-associative, i.e. x^4^2 is x^(4^2)

==Formulas==

    F ::= T=T | T!=T | T>=T | T>T | T<=T | T<T | p(T) | p() | C{F} | ⎵
        | !F | \forall x F | \exists x F | [P]F | <P>F 
        | F&F | F|F | F->F | F<->F | (F)' | (F)

with `->` right-associative and no precedence for `->` versus `<->`

==Programs==

    P ::= a; | x:=T; | x':=T; | ?F; | {D&F} | {P}* | P P | P++P

with `++` and the invisible `;` in P P right-associative, i.e. x:=1;x:=2;x:=3 is x:=1;{x:=2;x:=3}

This is to be contrasted with the abstract dL grammar in theory:

    P ::= a | x:=T | x':=T | ?F | D&F | P* | P;P | P++P | (P)

with the visible `;` in P;P right-associative

==Differential programs==

    D ::= c | x'=T | D,D

with `D,D` right-associative


Parser would-be challenges:  < ? p > q > p > 1
Parser expression challenges: f()    x'=5
